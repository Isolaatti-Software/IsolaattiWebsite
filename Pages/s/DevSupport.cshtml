<h2>Support the developer</h2>
<p>My name is Erik Cavazos, from MÃ©xico. I've been developing the platform for the last 1 year and a 
    half. You can help me by trying this out and give feedback, or by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/invoice/p/#NALCG5YHHDMS3XKA">donating</a> . You'd be helping me to keep the infraestructure up.
