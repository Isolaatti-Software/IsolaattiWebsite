        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>Read carefully the following.</p>

        <h2>Android application</h2>
        <p>The Android application (Isolaatti Android App since now) does work, but you might experiencie bugs, as it is under active development. Use this application with that in mind.</p>
        <p>Isolaatti Android App is provided as it is, without any warranty.</p>

        <h2>Service quality and availability</h2>
        <p>The service is running on a quite slow machine (call it the server). So, the isolation of tracks can take so long. I do not take any responsability due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delay due to high server load</li>
            <li>Slow responsiveness of the app due to slow API server</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This service is for private use only. Any public use should not be done as it could be interpreted as piracy.</p>

        <h2>Usage of your data</h2>
        <p>The app collects data about your habits; it means that every tap you do on solo buttons is recorded. This is for statistics use only.</p>
        <p>Your personal data is not shared to anyone.</p>
        <p>Emails from Isolaatti will not be sent to you, unless it is for a very important mater (Or if notifications by Email are enabled)</p>

        <h2>Data protection</h2>
        <p>We will never reveal your password or username. Keep in mind that your account could be suspended if we receive a report and it proceeds.</p>
        <p>Please, never reveal your password to anyone, otherwise your account could be stolen.</p>
